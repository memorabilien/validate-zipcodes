# validate-zipcodes
A Library of JavaScript Regular Expressions for validating if a specific Zip-code exists in a specific Country.

Not every 5 digit number is automatically a zip code... 
As of now Regular Expression seem to be the fastest way of validating if a zip code acutally exists.


As of now only the Regular Expressions for Germany and USA(5-Digit version) are availible. Although any 5 or 4 Digit number is possible. More coming soon...
